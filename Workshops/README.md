|2nd Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn) |[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2404.10378-b31b1b.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10378)<br><details><summary>TLDR</summary>1. Unconstrained synthetic data generally led to better performance than constrained synthetic data.<br>2. Combining synthetic and real data often yielded the best results, particularly in bias mitigation.<br>3. In some cases, unlimited synthetic data outperformed limited real data.<br>4. Most top teams used established methodologies like ResNet or IResNet backbones and AdaFace or ArcFace loss functions.<br>5. DCFace was widely used for synthetic data generation, often combined with other methods.<br>6. The challenge demonstrated significant improvements compared to the 1st edition, showcasing the potential of synthetic data in face recognition.</details>||<ul><li>Synthetic Data for FR
